# A Vision Based App for Maize Crop Management
# ZeaWatch: Maize Leaf Disease Detection

**ZeaWatch** is a mobile-based application that utilizes AI to detect leaf diseases in maize crops using images captured via a mobile camera. The app uses a hybrid model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transformers to provide accurate diagnoses and treatment suggestions for farmers.

## Features:
- **Leaf Disease Detection**: Upload or capture an image of maize leaves, and the app diagnoses any diseases.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Receive actionable feedback on treatment options and prevention methods.
- **Hybrid AI Model**: Combines CNN and Transformer for high-accuracy detection.
- **Offline Mode**: The model can run on the mobile device with TensorFlow Lite for offline usage.
